[1]
0.67 cloves   garlic, minced
0.17 yellow onion, medium, chopped
0.33 carrots, diced
0.33 stalks   celery, diced
0.33 yellow potatoes, diced
0.33 tsp dried oregano
0.83 cups vegetable broth
4.67 oz canned diced tomatoes
2.5 oz canned chickpeas, or beans of choice, drained and rinsed
0.92 cup whole wheat pasta shells
0.17 cup fresh parsley, chopped

Method:
1. Beans. Minestrone often contains beans (like kidney beans, cannellini beans, or chickpeas) for protein and texture.
2. Pasta. Additionally, pasta or rice is sometimes added to include a carb component and make the soup more substantial.
3. In a large pot, combine the garlic and onion with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water, and saute until softened, approximately 3 minutes.
4. Add the carrot, celery, potato, dried oregano, salt and pepper. Saute until the potato and carrot have softened, approximately 6 minutes.
5. Add the vegetable broth, diced tomatoes, chickpeas and pasta. Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered for 12 to 15 minutes, until the pasta is cooked. Garnish with fresh parsley as desired.

[1]
0.25 tablespoon olive oil
2 oz mushrooms crimini
4 oz potato gnocchi
0.25 cup heavy cream
1 cloves garlic minced
1.25 oz fresh spinach

Method:
1. Mushrooms. I used fresh crimini mushrooms. You can also use portobello mushrooms or shiitake.
2. Smoked paprika is another spice that adds both color and lots of flavor to this dish.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, high-sided, heavy-bottomed skillet. Cook sliced mushrooms (seasoned with salt and pepper) on high heat for about 1 or 2 minutes, until lightly browned and softened. Remove half of the cooked mushrooms from the skillet to a plate.
4. To the same skillet with the half of cooked mushrooms, add uncooked potato gnocchi, chicken broth, heavy cream, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, smoked paprika, and ¼ teaspoon salt.
5. Bring to a boil on medium heat and stir everything well. Cover with lid, and allow the gnocchi to cook for about 5 minutes on medium heat, while the sauce boils.
6. Add fresh spinach, and cook on medium heat, stirring frequently for 5 minutes until the spinach wilts to your liking. Cook longer if you would like a thicker sauce.

[1]
2.5 medjool dates, soaked in hot water for 5 minutes
0.5 cup plant-based milk
0.5 cup date seed coffee, regular coffee or more plant-based milk
1 tbsp cocoa powder
0.5 sprinkle   Cinnamon

Method:
1. Medjool dates are an easy way to blend in sweetness and caramel flavor into this drink.
2. Mexican Hot Chocolate (Chocolate Mexicano). Mayan and Aztec influences are still present in Mexican hot chocolate, which can include spices like cinnamon and chili peppers.
3. You can use any plant-based milk for this recipe. Personally, I really like cashew milk because it is so creamy and silky. But honestly, it works with any type of non-dairy milk.
4. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and pour it over the dates. Allow them to soak for 5 minutes, and then blend until a smooth paste is formed.
5. In a saucepan over medium heat, add the date paste, date seed coffee, plant-based milk, chocolate, cocoa powder and cinnamon. Whisk until everything is combined and heated, then enjoy immediately, with vegan marshmallows and whipped cream if desired.
