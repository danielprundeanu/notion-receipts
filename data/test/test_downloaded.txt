[1]
125 g beef mince
0.25 tbsp sunflower oil
0.38 tbsp dried oregano
0.5 tsp ground cumin
0.5 tsp paprika
3 corn tortillas
37.5 g Holy Moly Three Chilli Guacamole

# For the salsa
0.5 large tomatoes, finely chopped
0.06 onion, peeled and finely chopped
0.25 green chilli, seeds removed and finely chopped
0.25 garlic clove, finely grated
0.25 small bunch coriander, finely chopped
0.25 lime,  juiced

Method:
1. Place a large frying pan on a medium to high heat and when hot, add the mince. Break up with a wooden spoon and cook till most of the water has evaporated, breaking up any clumps. Add the oil, spices and salt and pepper and continue to cook till fragrant and the beef begins to crisp, 3 -4 minutes. Remove from the pan and keep warm.
2. To make the salsa, combine all the ingredients in a bowl.
3. Warm the tortillas quickly on each side in a hot, dry frying pan, then place inside a plastic bag, wrapped with a tea towel.
4. To serve, fill each tortilla with warm beef mince, some of the salsa and a spoonful of guacamole. Squeeze lime over the top before eating.
