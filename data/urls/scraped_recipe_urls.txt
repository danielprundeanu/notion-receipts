[Jalapeño-Peach Salsa]
[0.5] peaches, pitted and diced
[0.25] to 2 jalapeños seeds, fresh removed finely diced
[0.08 cup] cilantro, chopped fresh
[0.5 Tbsp] lime, fresh juice (from 1 lime)
[0.06 tsp] salt, kosher

[Zesty Cilantro Sauce]
[0.12 cup] cilantro, packed leaves and stems
[0.12 cup] onion, chopped green (scallions)
[0.12 cup] yogurt, plain 2% fat Greek
[0.06 cup] avocado, neutral oil (such as grapeseed or canola oil – I prefer using avocado oil)
[0.5 Tbsp] lime, fresh juice
[0.5] to 3 Tbsp. water
[0.12 tsp] salt, kosher

[BBQ Salmon Bowls]
[1] salmon, (6-ounce) skin-on center-cut fillets
[0.25 Tbsp] avocado oil
[0.25 Tbsp] coconut, sugar (or brown sugar)
[0.38 tsp] paprika
[0.25 tsp] chili powder
[0.19 tsp] garlic powder
[0.19 tsp] onion powder
[0.19 tsp] salt, kosher

Steps:
1. Customizable. When peaches aren’t in season, there are plenty of substitution options for the salsa. Not a fan of salmon? Chicken also works wonderfully here!
2. Ask for Center Cut Salmon. This part of the salmon fillet is thicker and juicier, and won’t overcook as easy as the tail end.
3. Prepare JalapeñoPeach Salsa by combining all ingredients (peaches, jalapeño, cilantro, lime, and salt) in a medium bowl; toss to combine. Set aside.
4. Prepare Zesty Cilantro Sauce by combining all ingredients (cilantro, green onion, yogurt, oil, lime, 2 Tbsp. water, and salt) in a food processor. Blend until smooth with bright green specks throughout. Add an additional 1 Tbsp. water as needed to thin out to desired consistency.
Zesty Cilantro Sauce
5. Position the oven rack to the upper third of your oven; it should be about 6 inches from the broiling element at the top. Preheat broiler to HIGH.Arrange salmon fillets, skin sidedown, on a large rimmed baking sheet or baking dish. Drizzle with 1 Tablespoons avocado oil. In a small bowl, combine sugar, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper; mix to combine. Season salmon fillets generously with spice mixture.Broil the salmon fillets, rotating the pan once halfway through, until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and appears medium in the center, about 8 to 9 minutes. If you prefer your salmon welldone, leave it in for 1 additional minute.
6. Serve salmon over white rice with a few spoonfuls of JalapeñoPeach Salsa and a generous drizzle of Zesty Cilantro Sauce.

Notes:
Nutrition information includes 1/2 cup of cooked white rice.
To Store. I suggest storing the salmon and rice separately from the fresh salsa and sauce. This way, you can rewarm the salmon and rice while keeping the cold components chilled.
To Reheat. Gently reheat the salmon and rice in the microwave or in a skillet over medium heat. Once warm, top with fresh salsa and sauce.

Notes:
To bake the meatballs, place on a greased baking sheet and bake at 425°F for 10 to 15 minutes.
To air fry the meatballs, lightly coat meatballs and tray with cooking spray, and air fry at 400ºF for 12 to 14 minutes.
MakeAhead. You can mix the meatball mixture and form it into balls up to 24 hours in advance. Just keep covered and refrigerated until ready to bake.
Store. Refrigerate leftover meatballs in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
Reheat. You can rewarm the meatballs in the oven, air fryer, or microwave. IF reheating frozen meatballs, preheat your oven to 350ºF (if the meatballs are fully cooked) or 400ºF (if not fully cooked). Arrange the meatballs in a baking dish coated with nonstick spray. Then, bake directly from frozen until hot, 20 to 30 minutes for cooked meatballs or 25 to 30 minutes for uncooked meatballs (until meatballs reach an internal temperature of 160ºF). Freeze. Let cooked meatballs cool completely. Then arrange on a parchmentlined baking sheet and freeze until the meatballs are firm; about 1 to 2 hours. Transfer the frozen chicken meatballs to a ziptop bag and tightly seal. Freeze for up to 3 months.

2. Begin preparing falafel by adding chickpeas, red onion, parsley, garlic, tahini, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender. Pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed, until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a crumbly dough, not a paste (as shown in photo).Add flour 1 Tbsp. at a time and pulse to combine until the mixture is dry enough to mold without it sticking to your hands.
3. Preheat oven to 400ºF and lightly coat a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Scoop out 2 rounded Tbsp. amounts of falafel mix and gently form into 12 discs. Arrange discs on prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake falafel for 25 to 30 minutes, gently flipping once halfway through, until golden and crisp.
4. While falafel bakes, begin preparing tzatziki.To start, partially peel the cucumber and slice it in half. Grate half the cucumber on a box grater into a clean kitchen towel. Press to expel as much moisture as possible, and transfer cucumber to a small bowl. Transfer soaked cashews and water to a high power blender, along with lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Blend mixture on HIGH until smooth and creamy. Transfer cashew mixture to the bowl with grated cucumber, and mix in dill, parsley, and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
5. Prepare cucumbertomato salad by chopping up remaining half of cucumber and placing in a bowl. Add tomatoes, avocado, red onion, and olive oil.
