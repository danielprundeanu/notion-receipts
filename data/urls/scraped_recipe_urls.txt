[1]
[0.25 cup] lb. butternut squash, peeled and cubed (about 5 )
[0.5 tbsp] olive oil, extra-virgin
[0.5 tsp] chili powder
[0.25 tsp] smoked paprika
[0.25 tsp] ground cumin
[0.19 tsp] salt, kosher divided
[0.25] bell pepper, poblano pepper seeded and cut into strips (sub of choice)
[7 g] beans, (15-. can) black
[0.5 tsp] peppers, adobo sauce (from a can of chipotle in adobo sauce)
[2] corn, small tortillas warmed

[Creamy Avocado Sauce]
[0.25 cup] cilantro, fresh leaves and stems
[0.12] avocado, medium ripe slice remaining half and use as garnish
[0.06 cup] orange juice, fresh
[0.75 tbsp] avocado oil, (or neutral oil of choice)
[0.5 tbsp] lime, fresh juice (from 1 lime)
[0.06 tsp] salt, kosher

Steps:
1. Adobo sauce: This is the sauce that chipotle peppers are canned in. It’s super smoky with a medium level of spice.
2. You can purchase a jar of pickled red onion or make them yourself (they’re super simple!). I follow this recipe.
3. Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss butternut squash with 2 Tbsp. olive oil, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes.Remove from oven and add poblano pepper slices and a touch more oil; toss to incorporate with spices. Place pan back in the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until squash is tender.
4. Meanwhile, prepare Avocado Sauce by combining cilantro, avocado, orange juice, oil, lime juice, and salt in a small blender or food processor (or use an immersion blender); blend until smooth. (You may need to add a splash of water or extra oil to thin out the sauce for more efficient blending.)
5. Drain black beans (no need to rinse). Shake off excess liquid and transfer to a microwavesafe bowl. Stir in adobo sauce and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Microwave for 45 to 60 seconds, until warm. Add to pan of roasted vegetables and toss well to incorporate with spices.
6. To assemble tacos, add a generous dollop of avocado sauce to each tortilla, and top with roasted butternut squash mixture. Garnish with pickled red onion, extra cilantro, cheese, and remaining half of avocado (sliced), if desired.

Notes:
You can purchase a jar of pickled red onion or make them yourself (they’re super simple!). I follow this recipe.
To Store. Refrigerate taco filling in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days. Store leftover sauce separately for up to 1 week.
To Reheat. Rewarm the veggie filling in a large skillet on the stovetop over medium heat or gently in the microwave. Add avocado sauce after fillings are reheated. I also suggest warming your tortillas fresh each time.
To Freeze. Freeze taco filling in an airtight freezersafe storage container for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.
