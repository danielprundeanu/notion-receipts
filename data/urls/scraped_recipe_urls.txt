[1]
[113.5 g] ground chicken
[0.25] zucchini, medium grated on a box grater (no need to press out excess moisture)
[0.12 cup] panko breadcrumbs
[0.12 cup] feta cheese, crumbled
[0.08 cup] yellow onion, minced (or shallots)
[0.5 tbsp] fresh dill, finely chopped (or parsley)
[0.5 tbsp] jalapeño, minced fresh
[0.25 tsp] lemon, zest
[0.19 tsp] salt, kosher
[0.19 tsp] garlic powder
[0.12 tsp] black pepper

[Cucumber-Avocado Salad (optional)]
[0.25] cucumber, English diced
[0.25] avocado, large cut into chunks
[0.5 tbsp] fresh basil, chopped dill or mint
[0.25] to 2 tbsp. lemon, fresh juice
[0.5 tbsp] olive oil, extra-virgin

Steps:
1. Combine all meatballs ingredients (ground chicken through black pepper) in a large bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly mix and mash the mixture together. Scoop and roll into 24 mini meatballs. (If the meatballs are sticking while rolling, moisten your hands with a little water or olive oil.)
2. Heat 1 to 2 Tbsp. of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half of meatballs and cook until golden, rotating to brown all sides, about 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with second batch, adding more oil as needed.
3. Meanwhile, prepare CucumberAvocado Salad by combining all ingredients in a large bowl; mix well.
4. Serve meatballs over white rice with CucumberAvocado Salad and a big scoop of tzatziki. Drizzle components with a little olive oil and garnish with extra fresh dill (optional) and cracked black pepper.

Notes:
To bake the meatballs, place on a greased baking sheet and bake at 425°F for 10 to 15 minutes.
To air fry the meatballs, lightly coat meatballs and tray with cooking spray, and air fry at 400ºF for 12 to 14 minutes.
MakeAhead. You can mix the meatball mixture and form it into balls up to 24 hours in advance. Just keep covered and refrigerated until ready to bake.
Store. Refrigerate leftover meatballs in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
Reheat. You can rewarm the meatballs in the oven, air fryer, or microwave. IF reheating frozen meatballs, preheat your oven to 350ºF (if the meatballs are fully cooked) or 400ºF (if not fully cooked). Arrange the meatballs in a baking dish coated with nonstick spray. Then, bake directly from frozen until hot, 20 to 30 minutes for cooked meatballs or 25 to 30 minutes for uncooked meatballs (until meatballs reach an internal temperature of 160ºF). Freeze. Let cooked meatballs cool completely. Then arrange on a parchmentlined baking sheet and freeze until the meatballs are firm; about 1 to 2 hours. Transfer the frozen chicken meatballs to a ziptop bag and tightly seal. Freeze for up to 3 months.
IF reheating frozen meatballs, preheat your oven to 350ºF (if the meatballs are fully cooked) or 400ºF (if not fully cooked). Arrange the meatballs in a baking dish coated with nonstick spray. Then, bake directly from frozen until hot, 20 to 30 minutes for cooked meatballs or 25 to 30 minutes for uncooked meatballs (until meatballs reach an internal temperature of 160ºF).

[0.25] cucumber, large English
[0.75 tbsp] lemon, juice
[0.25] garlic clove
[0.12 tsp] salt, kosher
[0.5 tbsp] fresh dill, finely chopped
[0.25 tbsp] fresh parsley, finely chopped
[0.06 tsp] black pepper

[Baked Falafel]
[7 g] chickpeas, (15.5-.) can rinsed drained and patted dry
[0.12 cup] red onion, roughly chopped
[0.12 cup] fresh parsley, packed
[0.5] garlic, cloves
[0.25 tbsp] tahini, (sesame seed paste)
[0.19 tsp] ground cumin
[0.12 tsp] smoked paprika
[0.12 tsp] black pepper, each kosher salt and
[0.75 tbsp] flour, all-purpose (sub chickpea flour)

[Additional Bowl Ingredients]
[0.38 cup] cherry tomatoes, halved
[0.25] avocado, medium peeled and diced
[0.08 cup] red onion, finely chopped
[0.5 tbsp] olive oil, extra-virgin
[1] handful, fresh arugula or greens of choice

Steps:
1. Place cashews in a small bowl and cover with 1/2 cup boiling water. Let cashews stand for 30 minutes while you prepare falafel.
2. Begin preparing falafel by adding chickpeas, red onion, parsley, garlic, tahini, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender. Pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed, until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a crumbly dough, not a paste (as shown in photo).Add flour 1 Tbsp. at a time and pulse to combine until the mixture is dry enough to mold without it sticking to your hands.
3. Preheat oven to 400ºF and lightly coat a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Scoop out 2 rounded Tbsp. amounts of falafel mix and gently form into 12 discs. Arrange discs on prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake falafel for 25 to 30 minutes, gently flipping once halfway through, until golden and crisp.
4. While falafel bakes, begin preparing tzatziki.To start, partially peel the cucumber and slice it in half. Grate half the cucumber on a box grater into a clean kitchen towel. Press to expel as much moisture as possible, and transfer cucumber to a small bowl. Transfer soaked cashews and water to a high power blender, along with lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Blend mixture on HIGH until smooth and creamy. Transfer cashew mixture to the bowl with grated cucumber, and mix in dill, parsley, and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
5. Prepare cucumbertomato salad by chopping up remaining half of cucumber and placing in a bowl. Add tomatoes, avocado, red onion, and olive oil. Gently toss to combine, and season to taste with salt and pepper. To assemble bowls, place 4 falafel, a handful of arugula, and a scoop of cucumbertomato salad into each of 4 bowls. Serve with cashew tzatziki and warm pita (if desired).
