[0.08 cup] chopped fresh cilantro
[0.5 Tbsp] fresh lime juice (from 1 lime)
[0.06 tsp] kosher salt

[0.12 cup] chopped green onion (scallions)
[0.12 cup] plain 2% fat Greek yogurt
[0.06 cup] neutral oil (such as avocado, grapeseed, or canola oil – I prefer using avocado oil)
[0.5 Tbsp] fresh lime juice
[0.5] to 3 Tbsp. water
[0.12 tsp] kosher salt

[BBQ Salmon Bowls]
[1] (6-ounce) skin-on, center-cut salmon fillets

Steps:
1. Customizable. When peaches aren’t in season, there are plenty of substitution options for the salsa. Not a fan of salmon? Chicken also works wonderfully here!
2. Ask for Center Cut Salmon. This part of the salmon fillet is thicker and juicier, and won’t overcook as easy as the tail end.
3. Prepare Jalapeño-Peach Salsa by combining all ingredients (peaches, jalapeño, cilantro, lime, and salt) in a medium bowl; toss to combine. Set aside.

4. Prepare Zesty Cilantro Sauce by combining all ingredients (cilantro, green onion, yogurt, oil, lime, 2 Tbsp. water, and salt) in a food processor. Blend until smooth with bright green specks throughout. Add an additional 1 Tbsp. water as needed to thin out to desired consistency.

5. Position the oven rack to the upper third of your oven; it should be about 6 inches from the broiling element at the top. Preheat broiler to HIGH.Arrange salmon fillets, skin side-down, on a large rimmed baking sheet or baking dish. Drizzle with 1 Tablespoons avocado oil. In a small bowl, combine sugar, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper; mix to combine. Season salmon fillets generously with spice mixture.Broil the salmon fillets, rotating the pan once halfway through, until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and appears medium in the center, about 8 to 9 minutes. If you prefer your salmon well-done, leave it in for 1 additional minute.
6. Serve salmon over white rice with a few spoonfuls of Jalapeño-Peach Salsa and a generous drizzle of Zesty Cilantro Sauce.

2. Begin preparing falafel by adding chickpeas, red onion, parsley, garlic, tahini, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender. Pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed, until thoroughly combined.

3. Preheat oven to 400ºF and lightly coat a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Scoop out 2 rounded Tbsp. amounts of falafel mix and gently form into 12 discs. Arrange discs on prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake falafel for 25 to 30 minutes, gently flipping once halfway through, until golden and crisp.
4. While falafel bakes, begin preparing tzatziki.To start, partially peel the cucumber and slice it in half. Grate half the cucumber on a box grater into a clean kitchen towel.

Blend mixture on HIGH until smooth and creamy. Transfer cashew mixture to the bowl with grated cucumber, and mix in dill, parsley, and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
