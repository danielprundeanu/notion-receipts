Știai că poți face acasă o Fanta probiotică, fără zahăr, fără chimicale, dar plină de beneficii pentru digestie?Această băutură fermentată este o alternativă sănătoasă, plină de probiotice, care îți echilibrează flora intestinală și îți oferă energie naturală!

Ingrediente:
1 cotor de ananas 
400 ml apă filtrată
800 ml suc de portocale proaspăt stors

Mod de preparare:
Fermentarea: Taie cotorul de ananas bucățele și pune-l într-un borcan curat. Adaugă 400 ml de apă filtrată, acoperă borcanul cu un capac și lasă-l la temperatura camerei, într-un loc cald și umbros, timp de 5-6 zile.➡️ Important: Deschide capacul o dată la 3 zile pentru a elibera presiunea formată în timpul fermentării.➡️ Fermentarea poate dura mai mult, în funcție de temperatura camerei.
Amestecul final: După fermentare, strecoară lichidul și amestecă 800 ml suc proaspăt de portocale și 200 ml din apa fermentată.
Fermentarea secundară: Toarnă băutura într-o sticlă, închide-o și las-o la temperatura camerei pentru încă 24 de ore, într-un loc umbros. Nu o lăsa prea mult, deoarece zahărul din suc poate fermenta rapid, iar băutura poate deveni alcoolizată.

1/3 cup Blackberry
1/3 cup Cherries

Directions

there are no flour streaks. Allow the batter to rest for about 5 minutes.
3 Heat a non-stick frying pan on medium heat (or use a little bit of cooking spray). Scoop the
batter onto the hot pan, using a small ladle or a squeezy bottle. After the edges of the pancake
start looking dry, gently pick the edges off the pan with a spatula and flip the pancake. Cook for
about a minute on the other side. Repeat with the rest of the batter.

with 2-3 tbsp of water. Heat up on medium heat and cook for about 10 minutes.
5 Stack your pancakes and top them with berry compote. Enjoy!

Gluten Free
Oat flour is generally gluten-free but if you have a severe reaction to gluten, double-check.
Soy Free
Replace soy milk with another non-dairy milk alternative.
Leftovers
If making in advance, store the compote separately. The pancakes keep for 2-3 days.

Hidden Veggie Mac & Cheese

40 minutes
3 servings

link: https://attachments.convertkitcdnn2.com/256011/0667f690-8375-4cff-9265-69b86ae8f866/7-Day_Meal_Plan.pdf

Ingredients
1/2 Onion (white, yellow, chopped)
1 1/2 Garlic cloves (large)
1/2 head Cauliflower (broken into
florets)
1/2 Bell pepper (red, roughly chopped)
1 cup Butternut squash (chopped)
1/2 Carrot (chopped)
1 1/2 tsp Paprika
1 1/2 tsp Garlic powder
1 tsp Sea salt
1 1/2 tbsp Tahini
1/4 cup Coconut milk
1 1/2 tbsp Hot sauce
3/4 cup Vegetable broth (low sodium)
1/4 cup Pasta water
2 tbsp Nutritional yeast
8 oz Macaroni (whole wheat, cooked)

Directions
1 Preheat the oven to 400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2 Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain the liquid, reserving some pasta
water for later.
3 Add the onion, garlic, cauliflower, bell pepper, squash and carrot to the baking sheet, along
with the paprika, garlic powder and sea salt sprinkled on top. Bake for 40 minutes, until all of the
vegetables are soft and tender.
4 Once safe to handle, add the ingredients to a high speed blender with the vegetable broth,
tahini, coconut milk, pasta water, hot sauce and nutritional yeast. Blend until a smooth “cheese”
sauce is formed, adding more vegetable broth as needed to thin. Taste and adjust salt as
desired.
5 Pour the desired amount of cheese sauce into your cooked macaroni, stir and enjoy
immediately. Use any remaining sauce as a delicious nacho or cracker dip

Notes
Less fat
If you want to lower the fat content of your sauce, you can simply use a little bit of plant-based
milk in place of coconut milk. If you’re worried that your sauce will not be thick enough, reduce
the amount of vegetable broth.
Gluten Free
You can enjoy this sauce with gluten-free pasta if you can’t have wheat.
Storage
This “cheese” sauce is freezer-friendly. Feel free to make a big batch and freeze the leftovers
for a later date.
