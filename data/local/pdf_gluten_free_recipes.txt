[1]
[120 g] red split lentils
[1 tsp] garam masala
[350 g] spinach
[4 tbsp] greek or coconut yoghurt
[12] cherry tomatoes, halved
[5] sprigs of coriander, finely chopped
[5 tsp] olive oil
[1] pinch salt and pepper

Intro:
I grew up eating a Nutella crepe for breakfast every morning – probably the biggest breakfast glucose spike you can imagine! So I've been on a quest to make super-good-for-me crepes every since. Here's my new creation.

Steps:
1. Cover the lentils with water and soak for at least 4 hours or overnight. When ready, drain, transfer to a blender with the garam masala, a pinch of salt and pepper and 200mL water. Blitz until completely smooth.
2. Place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. When really hot, pour 1/4 of the batter into the pan, swirl the pan to spread out the batter and cook for 3-4 minutes until the edges are crispy and bubbles have appeared on the surface. Flip and cook for 2 minutes on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter (using 1 teaspoon of oil for each one). Set the crepes aside and keep warm. The mixture makes four - save two for a day time snack.
3. Wipe the pan clean and add the remaining olive oil and spinach. Place on a medium heat and stir to wilt the spinach - this only takes a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. To serve, divide the yoghurt between two crepes, top with the wilted spinach, the tomatoes, and coriander.

[50 g] sunflower seeds
[1.5 tbsp] almond butter
[0.5 tsp] vanilla extract
[30 g] flaked almonds
[100 g] raspberries
[3 tbsp] greek or coconut yoghurt

Intro:
I get so many requests from you guys to make "sweet" breakfasts that don't lead to a glucose spike. This is almost like dessert for breakfast, but keeps us balanced as it's packed with protein, fiber, and fat. A delish.

Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/350°F/Gas 4. Put the sunflower seeds, almond butter and vanilla extract in a food processor and blitz until crumbly and starting to clump together. Stir the flaked almonds into the mixture.
2. Put the raspberries into an ovenproof ramekin dish (roughly 12 cm round and 4 cm deep) and mash lightly with a fork. Top with the crumble and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until the crumble is golden. Serve topped with yoghurt.
