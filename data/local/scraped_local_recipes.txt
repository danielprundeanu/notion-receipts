[1] pineapple, spine
[400 ml] water, filtered
[800 ml] orange juice, freshly squeezed

Steps:
1. Fermentarea: Taie cotorul de ananas bucățele și pune-l într-un borcan curat. Adaugă 400 ml de apă filtrată, acoperă borcanul cu un capac și lasă-l la temperatura camerei, într-un loc cald și umbros, timp de 5-6 zile.➡️ Important: Deschide capacul o dată la 3 zile pentru a elibera presiunea formată în timpul fermentării.➡️ Fermentarea poate dura mai mult, în funcție de temperatura camerei.
2. Amestecul final: După fermentare, strecoară lichidul și amestecă 800 ml suc proaspăt de portocale și 200 ml din apa fermentată.
3. Fermentarea secundară: Toarnă băutura într-o sticlă, închide-o și las-o la temperatura camerei pentru încă 24 de ore, într-un loc umbros. Nu o lăsa prea mult, deoarece zahărul din suc poate fermenta rapid, iar băutura poate deveni alcoolizată.
