[1] pineapple spine
[400 ml] filtered water
[800 ml] orange juice (freshly, squeezed)

1. Fermentation: Cut the pineapple spine into pieces and put it in a clean jar. Add 400 ml of filtered water, cover the jar with a lid and leave it at room temperature in a warm and shady place for 5-6 days. ➡️ Important: Open the lid once every 3 days to release the pressure formed during fermentation. ➡️ Fermentation may take longer, depending on the room temperature.

3. Secondary fermentation: Pour the drink into a bottle, close it and leave it at room temperature for another 24 hours in a shady place. Don't leave it too long, as the sugar in the juice can ferment quickly and the drink can become alcoholic.
